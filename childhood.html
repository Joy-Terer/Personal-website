        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Growing up , I had a wonderful childhood filled with happy memories, family experience and also painful moments.</p>
        <p>My family has always been a significant part of my life, teaching me the importance of exceling in my studies and also working smart and not just hard.</p>
        <p>I grew up listening to all those pieces of parental advice. To this day, I still receive them, especially from my mom and grandma.</p>
        <p>Generally for me growing up was hard especially when i had to transition from being the 'baby of the family' to a second born . But having family with me has always been a blessing. </p>
