WEB HOSTING AND DOMAIN NAME EXPLANATION
To make my website accessible online , i will use *GitHub* for version control and *Netlify* for web hosting.

         WEB HOSTING(Netlify)
*Netlify* integrates well with *GitHub* allowing easy update of data and also provides custom domain support , HTTPS security and good performance.

-The website source code will be stored in a GitHub repository , https://github.com/Joy-Terer/Personal-website , and Netlify will detect and fetch updates automatically whenever  i make changes.

              DOMAIN NAME
Automatically , Netlify provides a free subdomain (joy-terer.com)

I can also use a custom domain like (www.joy-terer.com), purchased from a domain registrar

Connect domain to Netlify by updating the DNS settings to aline with Netlify's server

              HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER
1. I will upload my website files to my GitHub.

2. Netlify will deploy the  website after authorisation from github and generate a public link.

3. After i purchase a custoom domain , i will link it to my Netlify,

4.When somone enters my domain name , the DNS directs them to my Netlify-hosted site

This setup will ensure the site is accessible , secure and user-friendlly.
