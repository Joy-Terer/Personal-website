        <h2>School & Learning</h2>
        <p>I attended <strong>Kapsoit Junior Academy</strong> for my primary education, where I attained my KCPE certificate. I also gained basic computer skills.</p>
        <p>In 2019, I joined <strong>Tengecha Girls High School</strong> in Kapkatet, where I sat for my KCSE exams after four years.</p>
        <p>During high school, I was part of the school's basketball team and an active member of the journalism club. I also honed my computer skills and expanded my knowledge in various fields, including mathematics.</p>
        <p>Later on, I joined <strong>Zetech University</strong>, where I am currently a third-year student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.</p>
